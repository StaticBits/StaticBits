## Shownotes

William is an iOS app developer for The Daily Mail, and was formerly very active in the jailbreak community. Currently his most popular tweak, Boxy, is ready for iOS 11 but he's waiting until the creator of Cydia updates the store for purchases.

Josh used to be a very passionate jailbreak enthusiast himself, he has blogged a lot about jailbreak topics and was very active in the community for many years. He also co-founded JailCast, which was a popular jailbreak podcast eventually taken over by ModMy and Mobile Nations.

They ended up chatting quite a bit about web development stuff, as Josh wouldn't shut up about it.

Stay tuned for more episodes with a revolving cast of guests and hosts!
